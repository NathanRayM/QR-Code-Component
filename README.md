## About The Project

A perfect first challenge if you're new to HTML and CSS. The card layout doesn't shift, so it's ideal if you haven't learned about building responsive layouts yet.

## Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

A challenge for me was creating the background color and image overlay that is only viewable in the hover state.

## Useful resources

No external resources were used for this challenge.
